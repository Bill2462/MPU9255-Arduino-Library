# MPU9255-Arduino-Library
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bill2462/MPU9255-Arduino-Library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Bill2462/MPU9255-Arduino-Library)

Arduino library for MPU9255 based modules. 

Read acceleration, angular velocity and magnetic flux density on your Arduino board using MPU9266 based IMU module connected via the I2C interface. 

## What works ?
- Acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field measurements. 
- Scale selection (from +- 2g , +- 250 dps to +- 16g , +-2000 dps).
- Power control (sleep mode, enabling / disabling internal components). 
- Reset control.
- Temperature measurements using build-in sensor.

## Compatible IDE
Library is compatible with arduino IDE 1.6 or newer.

## Support/issue
- It seems to be a software issue.
  Please open an issue on github.

- It seems to be a hardware issue. 
  Please ask in the official Arduino forum, where you will get a much faster answer than on github.

## Installation
1. Download library (Clone or download -> download zip).
2. Launch Arduino IDE.
3. Go to : sketch -> include library and select "add .zip library" option. 
4. Select location of downloaded library and click "open".
